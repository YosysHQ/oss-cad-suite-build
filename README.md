## Introduction

OSS CAD Suite is a binary software distribution for a number of [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) used in digital logic design. 
You will find tools for RTL synthesis, formal hardware verification, place & route, FPGA programming, and testing with support for HDLs like Verilog, Migen, and Amaranth.

OSS CAD Suite is a component of YosysHQ's Tabby CAD Suite:

## Installation

1. Download an archive matching your OS from [the releases page](https://github.com/jmi2k/oss-cad-suite-build/releases/latest).
2. Extract the archive to a location of your choice (for Windows it is recommended that path does not contain spaces)
3. On macOS to allow execution of quarantined files ```xattr -d com.apple.quarantine oss-cad-suite-darwin-x64-yyymmdd.tgz``` on downloaded file, or run: ```./activate``` in extracted location once.
4. Set the environment as described below.

Linux and macOS
```bash
export PATH="<extracted_location>/oss-cad-suite/bin:$PATH"

# or

source <extracted_location>/oss-cad-suite/environment
```

Linux and macOS (fish shell)
```bash
fish_add_path "<extracted_location>/oss-cad-suite/bin"

# or

source <extracted_location>/oss-cad-suite/environment.fish
```

Windows
```batch
from existing CMD prompt:
<extracted_location>\oss-cad-suite\environment.bat

from existing PowerShell prompt:
. <extracted_location>\oss-cad-suite\environment.ps1

to create new CMD prompt:
<extracted_location>\oss-cad-suite\start.bat
```

**NOTE:** when environment is set, `python3` from package becomes available as well, this enables usage of *Migen* and *Amaranth* HDL and *LiteX* libraries scripts as usual. When OSS CAD Suite is just added in PATH to use packaged python3 use `tabbypy3` to start python environment. For Windows, there are no wrappers and using environment.bat is only choice.

## Using LiteX

We provide you with Python 3.11 and all required software to be able to use LiteX. After activating `environment` it is possible to perform installation same as usual:

```bash
mkdir -p litex
cd litex
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enjoy-digital/litex/master/litex_setup.py
python3 litex_setup.py init
python3 litex_setup.py install
```

## Supported Architectures

### linux-x64
Any personal Linux based computer should just work; no additional packages need to be installed on the system to make OSS CAD Suite work.
Distributed libraries are based on Ubuntu 20.04, but everything is packaged in such a way so it can be used on any Linux distribution.

### darwin-x64
Any macOS 12.00 or later with Intel CPU should use this distribution package.

### darwin-arm64
Any macOS 12.00 or later with M1/M2 CPU should use this distribution package.

### windows-x64
This architecture is supported for Windows 10 and 11. 

### linux-arm64
ARM64 based Linux devices using 64bit CPU as in Raspberry Pi 4,5 and 400 (with 64bit version of OS installed), and also laptops like the MNT Reform 2 can use this distribution package.

## Contributing

To be able to build OSS CAD Suite yourself, you need to install `docker` (please note this only works on x64 platforms or under rosetta on macos-arm) and `python 3.6` or higher, with the `click` library.


After that just running ```./builder.py``` should work fine.

To build default build:
```bash
./builder.py build 
```

To skip update of source code, you can always:
```bash
./builder.py build --no-update
```

To build specific target and architecture:
```bash
./builder.py build --target=yosys --arch=linux-arm64
```

## Alternatives

If your project is primarily written in Python (using tools such as Amaranth or LiteX), and you only need synthesis and PnR tools, you might find [YoWASP](https://yowasp.org) more suited to your needs since it allows managing installation and versioning of these tools in the same way as any other Python package dependencies.
